K-Means Clustering Tutorial
Overview
This project provides a tutorial on K-Means Clustering, a popular machine learning technique used for unsupervised learning. In this tutorial, we explore how K-Means Clustering works, how to implement it using Python, and how to interpret the results. This project includes both theoretical explanations and hands-on code demonstrations to help users understand and apply K-Means Clustering.
The goal of this project is to help students and enthusiasts understand the K-Means Clustering algorithm and its applications. 

It demonstrates how to:
Preprocess data
Apply K-Means Clustering to a dataset
Evaluate the clustering performance
Visualize results
